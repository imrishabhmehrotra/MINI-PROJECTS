<h1 align="center">HUNT THE MOLE GAME</h3>

### About The Project
This is a standard Whack-A-Mole game and has a waist-level cabinet with a play area and a display screen, as well as a huge, soft black mallet. Five holes in the top of the play area are stuffed with small plastic moles that appear at random. Whacking each mole as it appears earns you points. The higher the score, the faster the reaction.
