        <p id="paragraph"> Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

            "Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly. </p>
