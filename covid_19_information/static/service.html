        <h1> UN/DESA Policy Brief #79: The role of public service and public servants during the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
        <p> The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 180 countries, infected more than 6.5 million people and killed more than 383,000 (as of 3 June 2020). In addition to the health implications and loss of life, the pandemic has strained health care systems, disrupted the education system, wreaked havoc on businesses and economies, led to job losses and disrupted social life with lockdowns, curfews and other stringent measures aimed at containing the virus being implemented globally. All this has happened in the context of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, where the Public Service and Public Servants are critical.</p>

        <p> The following are identified as the roles public servants play in implementing the 2030 Agenda:1 (i) policy and strategy planning; (ii) provision of services; (iii) development of infrastructure; (iv) mobilization and utilization of resources; (v) monitoring and evaluation; and (vi) institutional and human resource capacity development.</p>

        <p> The abrupt and brutal disruption by the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the public service and public servants into a frenzy, forcing them to not only deal with fighting its spread but trying to manage its accompanying socioeconomic fallout. It has catapulted public servants onto the frontlines in the response to the crisis without any clear roadmap, forcing them to deal with a quickly and ever-changing situation and improvising along the way.</p>
        <h1> The role of public service and public servants in the fight against the covid-19 pandemic</h1>
        <p> From frontline healthcare workers and public health officials to teachers, sanitation workers, social welfare officers and more, the humble public servant has been thrust into the spotlight, helping elevate awareness and understanding of the critical role public servants play in everyday life, and in particular during times of severe crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <p>In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic however, public servants are working under life-threatening circumstances. In all COVID-19 pandemic affected countries they are both expected to deliver services despite the pandemic while at the same time suffering its impact, either by being directly infected or having family members who are. Moreover, the pandemic hit the world at a time when, according to World Health Organization (WHO), the world needs six million more nurses and midwives to achieve global health targets within the SDGs. These critical workers are confronting a dangerous highly infectious virus but they in insufficient numbers.</p>
