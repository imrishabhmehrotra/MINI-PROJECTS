        <h1>Benefits of Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</h1> 
        <h2> COVID-19 vaccines are safe</h2>  
        <li>COVID-19 vaccines were developed using science that has been around for decades.</li> 
        <li> COVID-19 vaccines are not experimental. They went through all the required stages of clinical trials. Extensive testing and monitoring have shown that these vaccines are safe and effective.</li>
        <li>COVID-19 vaccines have received and continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. Learn more about how federal partners are ensuring COVID-19 vaccines work.</li>
        <h2> COVID-19 vaccines are effective</h2>
        <li>COVID 19-vaccines are effective. They can keep you from getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Learn more about the different COVID-19 vaccines.</li> 
        <li> COVID-19 vaccines also help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19.</li>
        <li>Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</li> 
        <h2>Once you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing more</h2> 
        <li> After you are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, you can resume many activities that you did before the pandemic.</li>
        <li>CDC recommends that fully vaccinated people wear a mask in public indoor settings if they are in an area of substantial or high transmission.</li> 
        <li>Fully vaccinated people might choose to mask regardless of the level of transmission, particularly if they or someone in their household is immunocompromised or at increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in their household is unvaccinated. People who are at increased risk for severe disease include older adults and those who have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, overweight or obesity, and heart conditions.</li> 
        <li> People are not considered fully vaccinated until 2 weeks after their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or 2 weeks after a single-dose of Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. You should keep using all the tools available to protect yourself and others until you are fully vaccinated.</li>
        <li> Learn more about COVID-19 vaccination for people with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.</li>
        <h2> COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build protection</h2>
        <li> Get vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. Studies have shown that vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID-19,.</li>
        <li> Learn more about the clinical considerations for people were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, or history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children (MIS-A or MIS-C).</li>
        <li> COVID-19 is still a threat to people who are unvaccinated. Some people who get COVID-19 can become severely ill, which could result in hospitalization, and some people have ongoing health problems several weeks or even longer after getting infected. Even people who did not have symptoms when they were infected can have these ongoing health problems.</li>
