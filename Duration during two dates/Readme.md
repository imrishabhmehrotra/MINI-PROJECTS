### The idea behind this project
It's turned very tough when you have assigned with that count the total between the 1/18 to 6/28.

### How does it work

For minimizing the workload we have this alternative while loading the project we will have a text box for two dates and below the will submit button just click it you will get the actual days between two dates of the preview message.

- [x] Html
